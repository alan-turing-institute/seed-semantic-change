Folders for evaluation and sense labelling:

- SCAN_BCAC
- SCAN_dT1_minus2
- SCAN_dT3_minus2


OLD folders:

- SCAN_BCAC: it contains the output with probabilities for each iteration for 2 time points (before Christ - after Christ).
- SCAN_dT3: it contains the output with probabilities for each iteration from -3 to 21 with dT = 3.
- SCAN_dT1: it contains the output with probabilities for each iteration from -3 to 10 with dT = 1.
- SCAN_dT1_minus2: it contains the output with probabilities for each iteration from -2 (3rd century BC) to 10 (10th century AC) with dT = 1.
- SCAN_dT3_minus2: it contains the output with probabilities for each iteration from -2 (3rd century BC) to 21 (21st century AC) with dT = 3.
